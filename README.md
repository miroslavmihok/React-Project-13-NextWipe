### Description:
NextWipe is an interactive tool designed for Rust game enthusiasts to easily discover servers based on specific criteria such as server type, wipe schedule, and group size. The platform provides essential server information, including a direct connect feature through a Steam link. Users can efficiently filter and explore servers, and detailed information can be accessed with a simple click on the server container.

There are only 20 servers inside my database for which I am fetching data for.

### Filters
Users can filter the servers by 
- type (vanilla/official or modded)
- wipe schedule
- group size
- or title of the server

### Server buttons
Users can also copy the IP address of the given server or directly connect to the Rust Game Server if steam and Rust are installed (only on desktop).

### Additional server information
Users can also view additional information of the given server by clicking on its container.

### Installation:
1. git clone
2. cd your-project
3. npm install
4. npm start
